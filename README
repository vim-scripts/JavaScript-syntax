Hi JavaScript and VIM funs, 

If you want to use VIM to edit/view the JavaScript files, you should have this one. 
Replace it with the javascript syntax file included with the VIMRUNTIME.

Why it is here:
Because I found that the originaly one which packed with the VIMRUNTIME didn't work very well for the JS files in Mozilla Browser/SeaMonkey/Firefox and Dojo. So I decided to some refine on it. 

Hope it is also useful for you~~~

Good Luck,
